                        He was looking for a powerful color contrast.
                        By putting the purple flowers against a yellow background,
                        the decorative forms came out extra bright.
                        The irises were originally purple.
                        The flowers became blue because of the bleaching of a red pigment.
                        Van Gogh painted the bouquet twice.

                        In these landscapes,
                        Van Gogh tried to express sadness,
                        extreme loneliness.
                        However, the overwhelming emotions that Van Gogh experienced in nature were also positive.
                        To his brother, Theo, he wrote:
                        I'm almost certain that within the canvases,
                        I worded what I couldn't express in words,
                        nl.
                        How healthy and heart strengthening I find this countryside.
                        This was made in his last weeks.

                        For a long time, Van Gogh struggled with the display of figures.
                        they looked too flat.
                        In 1885,
                        he discovered that he had to build them out of big round forms instead of contours.
                        The burly farmer is a successful example of that.
                        The proportions are admittedly not correct,
                        but Van Gogh did this on purpose.
                        With this,
                        he wanted to enlarge the expression.

                        He had a preference for folk figures.
                        He emphasized the dramatic of the performance with the title:

                        Van Gogh made around 40 drawings of farmers heads,

                        with this,

                        Van Gogh wanted the farmers a specific kind of person,
